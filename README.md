# A-algorithm-implementaion
A-star algorithm implementation and visualization 

# Steps to run the file
1. Download the folder into the 'src' folder of your catkin workspace.
2. Build the catkin workspace.
3. Execute the command 'roslaunch lab8 lab8.launch' to view the robot moving from start position(fixed) to goal position (can be changed) following path planned by A*      algorithm in ROS-Stage environment.
4. Along with the above visualization, you can see the path taken by the robot in the terminal as well as all the nodes explored by the A* star algorithm before finding    the optimal path between start to goal node.
